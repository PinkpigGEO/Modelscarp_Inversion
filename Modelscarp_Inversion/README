OVERVIEW

This code computes the Receiver Function inversion using a
Trans-dimensional Bayesian approach. This code is based on code
written by Thomas Bodin and is described in his Thesis and the
publication below:

  "Transdimensional Approaches to Geophysical Inverse Problems",
  Thomas Bodin,  
  PhD Thesis, October 2010, Australian National University

  "Transdimensional inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersion",
  Bodin, T., Sambridge, M., Tkalčić, H., Arroucau, P., Gallagher, K., and Rawlinson, N., 
  J. Geophys. Res., 117, B02301. doi:10.1029/2011JB008560. 

Note that this code implements the Gaussian Correlation error model as
described in the above paper.

INSTALLING

The software requires the rjmcmc library and if this prerequisite is
in a standard place then you can compile this software with the
following commands:

> ./configure
> make

and optionally:

> sudo make install

The Rf software uses pkg-config to configure itself while building. If
the rjmcmc library is installed into a non-standard directory (eg a
users home directory) or to a path that is not by default in
pkg-config's search path then you will need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
environment variable, eg for bash users:

> export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/rjmcmc/lib/pkg-config
> ./configure
> make

QUICKSTART

To run, you need to supply as a minium a data file to the program, so
at a minimum, the following command line would run a Receiver function
inversion (with the example dataset supplied with the source):

> rf -d data/RF_obs.dat

Other command line options can found by running the programs with the
"-h" command line option, ie

> rf -h

The recommended method for running the rf applications is using
namelist input files.  An example namelist file is provided in the
data subdirectory and this file is commented to describe the different
parameters.

FILE FORMATS

The input data file format is a simple space separated ASCII text
file of the input signal. See the data/RF_obs.dat file for an 
example.

TUTORIAL

There is a tutorial introduction to using this software in the
tutorial subdirectory. This document is prepared in latex and can be
regenerated using:

> cd tutorial
> pdflatex tutorial.tex

It is recommended that new users run through this tutorial as a
starting point.
